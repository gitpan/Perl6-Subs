Revision history for Perl6-Subs

0.05	04/13/2005
	Create private error function (Perl6::Subs::_error, but don't call it
	yourself).  Change generated code to use it instead of Carp::croak
	(which ignores intramodule calls and was therefore the Wrong Choice).

0.04	04/06/2005
	Lots more documentation.
	The "code_only" rules for Filter::Simple are _too_ simple,
	  so use "executable" instead (everything but pod and data).
	Skip over block comments - don't search them for sub headers.
	Make author-only debugging messages depend on $PERL6_SUBS_DEBUG > 1.

0.03	03/28/2005
	Support new parameter types Rule and IO:
	  a Rule is a Regexp object (qr//).
	  an IO is an IO handle (*STDOUT{IO}), or a glob, or a glob reference.
	Document that C<is copy> is the default.
	Separate rules for parameter and sub traits (the latter are more relaxed).
	More carefully set debugging for Parse::RecDescent usage.

0.02	03/24/2005
	Support "required" attribute for named parameters, e.g. C< +$a is required >.
	Add "HACKING" document.
	Change license to LGPL.

0.01    03/24/2005
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
